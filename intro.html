    <p> <h3>History</h3> </p>
  <p>As the name suggests, the German Shepherd originated in Germany in the late 1800s. The most intelligent, responsive and obedient local shepherd dogs in Germany were bred to create what is now known as the German Shepherd. This breed was responsible for herding sheep and protecting flocks from predators. They were not considered pets or companions, but rather servants for farmers. Their intelligence, speed, strength and keen sense of smell, made them the perfect choice as sheep herders. Although German Shepherds were considered strictly workers, rather then household pets, farmers did provide food, protection and shelter to the breed.

  By the beginning of World War I the German Shepherd was popular throughout Germany and quickly spread to other parts of the world. People loved German Shepherds for their loyal and couragous character. </p>

    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p> Males stand 24 to 26 inches; females stand 22 to 24 inches. Weight ranges from 75 to 95 pounds.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Personality </h3>
    <p> The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. They're reserved dogs; they don't make friends immediately, but once they do, they're extremely loyal. With their family, they're easy-going and approachable, but when threatened, they can be strong and protective, making them excellent watchdogs.</p>
    <p>
     One thing they're not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship they need—as well as exercise and the chance to put their intelligence to work—they become bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who's under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.</p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Health </h3>
    <p> German Shepherds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all German Shepherds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed. The list of common health challenges associated with German shepards includes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hip Dysplasia </li>
      <li>Elbow Dysplasia</li>
      <li>Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus</li>
      <li>Degenerative Myelopathy</li>
      <li>Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</li>
      <li>Allergies</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> Feeding </h3>
    <p> A German Shepherd Dog diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your German Shepherd Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.</p>
    <p> Overfeeding your German Shepherd and letting them pack on the pounds can cause joint problems, as well as other health conditions. Limit treats, keep them active, and serve them regular meals rather than leaving food available at all times.</p>
